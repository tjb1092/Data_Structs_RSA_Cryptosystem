 +This will log the various components of the code and will keep track of what is completed.
 +
 +-Transform ASCII -> base 27 ints
 +Ex. "Test" -> "20 5 19 20"
 +
 +-Convert from base 27 -> Decimal
 +
 +-Convert from Decimal -> base 27 -> ACII
 +(See project insructions)
 +
 +-Naive primality testing
 +only loop to sqrt(n) iterations
 +
 +-random prime number generator
 +
 +-euclids ext gcd algorithm 
 +
 +-create p & q and calculate n = pq
 +
 +-compute totient of n. i.e phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)
 +
 +
 +-get user to enter e, the public key. 1 < e < phi(n)
 +Ask to redo input if e is not relatively prime to n. Repeat till gcd(e,n)/(e,phi(n)) = 1.
 +
 +-compute the modular multiplicative inverse. i.e. d = e^(-1) mod(phi(n))
 +
 +Encryption algorithm
 +Text (M) -> decimal (m)
 +C = m^e mod(n)
 +
 +Decryption algorithm
 +C^d = (m^e)^d = m mod n 
 +i.e. P = raise cipher text to the d power mod n.
 +decimal -> text
 +
 +output p q n M C P
